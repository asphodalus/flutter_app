App developed as a replacement for the god-awful Westlake Boys' High School [Portal](portal.westlake.school.nz), notorious for being shitty on desktop, let alone mobile. WIth the new portal being introduced, and the old portal being sunsetted, this is mainly for archival purposes.

Features:
 - One time login
 - Interactive attendence chart
 - Android widget to quickly access NCEA info

Build: 
 - Clone the repo, and then make sure you have flutter installed. To build for mobile, import the project into Android Studio and build the APK there. Make sure to install all packages required!
